title: Stable Diffusion
summary: Introduce all models that are related to stable diffusion
description: In the ever-evolving landscape of image generation models, diffusion-related approaches have surged in popularity, accompanied by other notable advancements. I will show how score based generative models are related to several different state-of-art generative models. The discussion will encompass a comparative analysis of diffusion models with score-based generative models, showcasing how diffusion techniques can be effectively incorporated into the score-based framework. Additionally, I will explore intriguing possibilities where classifiers can guide the diffusion process, allowing for the generation of image samples based on specific class labels or textual inputs.
